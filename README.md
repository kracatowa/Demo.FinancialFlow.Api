## Architecture

This project’s structure is inspired by Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.  
It is organized to promote separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability for .NET backend solutions.

A closely related reference project by Microsoft is [eShopOnContainers](https://github.com/dotnet/eShop), which demonstrates similar architectural patterns and best practices.
